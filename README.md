Standalone version of [React components](http://www.jeromecukier.net/blog/2016/08/13/beyond-rendering/) exercises by Jerome Cukier.

As a starting point I've chosen the package [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/07/22/create-apps-with-no-configuration.html) so some files from there might be still left in the repo.
